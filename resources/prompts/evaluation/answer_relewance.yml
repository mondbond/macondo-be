    description: Evaluate the relevance of an answer to a question
    template: |
      You are an evaluator. Assess the following response for relevance to the user question.
      Relevance score is a float number between 0 and 1, where 1 means the response is perfectly relevant to the question, and 0 means it is completely irrelevant. 0.5 is somehow relevant and 0.7 is quite relevant but not perfect.
      EXAMPLE OF OUTPUT:
      0.8
      or
      0.5
      or 0.0 if completely irrelevant
      no more text in answer - only the score. Output should be structural and parsed
