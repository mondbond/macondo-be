    description: Evaluate the relevance of an answer to a question
    template: |
      You are an impartial evaluator. Your task is to assess whether the provided answer is fully grounded in the given context.  

      - If every part of the answer is directly supported by the context, score it as 1.0 (fully grounded).
      - If some parts are supported but others are speculative or unrelated, score it between 0.1 and 0.9 depending on the degree of grounding.
      - If the answer is entirely unsupported or contradicts the context, score it as 0.0 (not grounded).
      
      Respond with only a single floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0. No need text in answer - only the score. Output should be structural and parsed

      You are an evaluator that gives a single numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0.

      Respond strictly in this JSON format:
      
        "score": "<value between 0.0 and 1.0>"
      
  
      Example:
      
        "score": "0.85"
