    description: Evaluate the relevance of an context to a question
    template: |
      You are an impartial evaluator. Your task is to assess how relevant the provided context is to the given question.  
      
      Scoring rules (return only a single float number between 0.0 and 1.0):
        - 1.0 = Context is fully relevant. It directly answers or strongly supports answering the question.
        - 0.5 = Context is partially relevant. It contains some useful information but also irrelevant or missing key details.
        - 0.0 = Context is not relevant at all. It does not help answer the question or is entirely unrelated.
      Respond with only a single floating-point number: 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0
      
      You are an evaluator that gives a single numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0.

      Respond strictly in this JSON format:
        
          "score": "<value between 0.0 and 1.0>"
      
      
      Example:
        
          "score": "0.85"
